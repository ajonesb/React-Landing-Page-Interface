# Interface Development Test

## Design assets
* Invision public URL: https://projects.invisionapp.com/share/5WQPC1IJM9N
* You should also have been added to the board to have access to the inspect tab.

## Test instructions
Attached you will find two screenshots representing two content blocks in a page. Complete the following:
* The code should be submitted on a public github account. Bonus points for more than one commit.
* Build the two blocks using modern HTML5 standards.
* Build a container area to house the two sections; there are no dimensional requirements for this although we're looking for something similar to bootstrap's `.container` class.
* Use JavaScript to capture all anchor clicks, and `console.log()` the element which has been clicked.
* As with any modern web-build we expect a level of interactivity/animation to be displayed on the nodes.
* All content areas should be deemed as being populated from a CMS - so all copy lengths can vary!

## Technologies
* Any CSS-preprocessors (LESS preferred).
* Any CSS frameworks (Bootsrap preferred).
* If vanilla CSS is used, please include some reasoning for the decision.
* Build tools and task runners are encouraged (i.e. grunt/gulp/webpack).

## Layout
* The layout is expected to work in the latest Chrome/FireFox/Edge versions.
* The layout should be responsive and work down to a `320px` mobile device.
* Bearing in mind that this application is expected to be responsive, the developer should consider the appropriate `<meta>` tags.
* *Section: All the latest:* Each image in this section should display in a modal on click.
* *Section: Answer your body's needs:* These items should be links to new pages.

## Review Criteria
We are looking for your ability to give life to static designs. During that process consider:
* *Project structure:* Clean project and logical traversal.
* *JavaScript:* Efficiency of code and efficacy in bringing the design to life.
* *Interface:* Semantic markup and styling.
* *Git:* Bonus points for submission on a github account showing multiple commits.
* *Quality:* Production-grade.

Project Starter:
************************************************************************************

### npm install
Installs React 
Installs React Router and React Router Dom (for future development of routing from component to component if neccessary), installs Webpack module bundler for building the project with react script start, and Installs SCSS pre processor. 

### `yarn build` or `npm run build`
Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

### `npm start`
In the project directory, you can run to start up the web application:
Local:http://localhost:3000/
